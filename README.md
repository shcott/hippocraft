A proof of concept project of a randomly generated endless voxel-based 3D map in Unity3D. The project currently consists of three main parts:

### Chunk Tile System
Designed a system in that renders chunks, collections of 3D tiles at distinct chunk coordinates, such that hidden tile faces are efficiently hidden.

### Procedural Terrain Generation
Implemented pseudo-random natural terrain generation using the Value noise algorithm.

### Chunk Auto-loading (in progress)
Write an algorithm to auto-generate chunks according to the userâ€™s position.

## Controls
* WASD - Movement
* Space - Jump
* Shift - Run
